# Faussaire

**Faussaire** is a modern alternative to the popular Faker gem in Ruby, tailored for more local-specific data generation. It supports French, Greek, and a minimalistic version in English named Globish, offering more realistic and culturally relevant data generation for developers.

## Why using Faussaire if Faker already exists ?

**Faussaire** was developed with specific goals in mind:

- üá´üá∑ **French:** To provide comprehensive and realistic French data, improving upon the sometimes generic output of Faker. This effort also aims to showcase French cultural heritage to a global audience.
- üá¨üá∑ **Greek:** Despite being spoken by 15 million people, Greek is often overlooked due to its unique alphabet. **Faussaire** includes support for Greek to address this gap.
- üåç **Globish:** In an increasingly globalized world, a "globish" approach is essential. **Faussaire** offers localized data where relevant while maintaining English to ensure broad usability.
